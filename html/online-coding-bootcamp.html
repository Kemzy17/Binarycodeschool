        <p>
          Whether you’re changing or expanding your career path or simply
          exploring the field, an online coding bootcamp is an investment in
          your future:

            <p>
              You’ll participate in live online coding instruction from your
              personal workspace, collaborating with others every step of the
              way to help reinforce understanding.

            <h3>Specialized Career Training</h3>
            <p>
              Coding bootcamps are geared toward teaching the most relevant
              skills you’ll need to succeed as a software engineer, and even
              offer career success programming to help you achieve your goals.

            <h3>Hands-On Methodology</h3>
            <p>
              Active learning (or, to put it simply, learning by doing) is an
              integral part of both learning to code and the day-to-day life of
              a software engineer—which is why online coding bootcamps allow
              ample time for self-practice in addition to collaborative coding
              exercises.

            <h3>Accelerated Pace</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike a traditional 4-year computer science degree, online coding
              bootcamps are designed to rapidly ramp up your skills at a
              rigorous pace and help you enter the workforce sooner.

        <p>
          The Software Engineering Immersive begins with a comprehensive
          Foundations on-ramp to support both intermediate and beginner coders.
          Designed to help all students reach a uniform skill level, Foundations
          covers the basic tenets of programming to prepare for the core
          curriculum—which moves through more advanced, specialized JavaScript
          concepts at a rapid bootcamp pace.
        </p>
        <h2>Foundational Software Engineering Curriculum</h2>

        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Second" class="tabcontent">
        <p>
          You’ll study HTML5, CSS, and advanced CSS—and go beyond with
          fundamental Javascript concepts.

        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          <span>&check;</span><b>Web Interface and Design</b> - You’ll learn how
          content and imagery are best displayed on a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&check;</span><b>Front-End Framework</b> - You’ll start to
          understand pre-written modules and their primary use cases in web
          development.
        </p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
          <span>&check;</span><b>Pair Programming</b> - Working with a fellow
          student, you’ll each use your newfound knowledge to write and optimize
          front-end code. This helps you build real-world experience and prepare
          for technical coding interviews.

          You’ll apply your JavaScript skills with the amazing ecosystem of
          libraries that have made JavaScript the industry standard of web
          engineering. We’ll also teach you to use APIs (Application Programming
          Interfaces) to connect to vast amounts of data to power your web
          applications.
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>

        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          <span>&check;</span><b>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</b> -
          Particularly relevant in JavaScript development, the TDD methodology
          allows developers to test new code before writing it—preserving its
          former iteration in case of incompatibilities or errors.
        </p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
          <span>&check;</span><b>Prototyping</b> - Throughout bootcamp, you’ll
          begin each project by scoping, researching, and beginning to build
          full stack web applications—touching on every stage of a typical,
          real-world prototype development process.

          <span>&check;</span><b>Full Stack Capstone Project</b> - You will work
          with a team of students to come up with an ambitious idea for an app,
          and start building it out. This will be the most impressive project in
          your portfolio and will demonstrate your full understanding of
          software development and industry best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&check;</span><b>Full Stack Project Pitching</b> - After
          formulating your own idea for a web or mobile application, you’ll
          pitch it to the class. Taking market, design, and utility
          considerations into account, you’ll understand through your pitch
          process how development projects come to fruition in real-world
          scenarios.
        </p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
          <span>&check;</span><b>Portfolio Development</b> - As you complete

            Within 4 weeks, I received 2 job offers at companies I was really
            excited about. During my interviews, both companies were pleasantly
            surprised by how knowledgeable and capable a bootcamp grad could be.
            Truly, I owe it all to Binary Code School's education and
            preparation.

          Why should I choose the Software Engineering Bootcamp at Binary Code

            No matter where you are in your coding journey, you can hone the
            skills, knowledge, and practical experience of a professional web
            developer with Binary Code School. As a trusted trailblazer in tech
            education, we’ve helped over 10,000+ students graduate job-ready

          Why does Binary Code School teach Full Stack JavaScript?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            The future of web development has moved toward sophisticated,
            responsive, and dynamic single-page applications running in the
            browser. Apps like Gmail, Asana, Trello, Facebook, and Google Maps
            have redefined what users expect from web applications and what
            developers need to deliver. After observing these trends, plus
            conducting lots of research and conversations with industry experts,
            we’ve come to the conclusion that full stack JavaScript is the
            future of web development. Consequently, it is what we primarily
            immerse our students in at Binary Code School. What about Ruby on
            Rails, Python, or other engineering languages? Why are other schools
            teaching these-or a combination of these- instead? Ruby on Rails has
            been instrumental in consolidating many best practices in back-end
            web development–making it easier for developers to build large sites
            in an organized way. Meanwhile, Python has completely revolutionized
            the way sites record and use data—and we do teach Python
            foundational skills in our Data Analytics bootcamps. Primarily,
            though, research and use cases show that today’s web runs on highly
            interactive and responsive experiences that don’t require a page
            refresh at every step. As a result, single-page applications (SPAs)
            written in JavaScript using frameworks like React or Vue.js make
            JavaScript one of the best programming languages to learn.
            JavaScript also offers professional advantages over other languages.
            Binary Code School graduates are well-rounded coders with both a
            thorough understanding of the full stack and programming concepts in
            general. We’ve learned through years of tech education that students
            may more easily understand and master other coding languages once
            they’ve learned full stack JavaScript. This gives our graduates a
            more in-demand skill set that separates them from the competition
            and widens the range of coding job types they’re qualified for.
