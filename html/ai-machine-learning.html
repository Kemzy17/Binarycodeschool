          As artificial intelligence grows more relevant across all major
          industries, data and other tech professionals with concentrated AI and
          machine learning experience are more in-demand than ever before.
          Specialization in this field may require different skills—depending on
          your unique professional experience and goals—but successful AI
          specialists are typically skilled in many of the following concepts
          and technologies:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data science processes, data wrangling, data exploration, and
            hypothesis building and testing
          </li>
          <li>Applied data science with Python</li>
          <li>Machine learning models and accuracy metrics</li>
          <li>
            Deep Learning concepts and their relevant applications and tools,
            such as Keras, Python, and TensorFlow
          </li>
          <li>Text-to-speech conversion with automated speech recognition</li>
