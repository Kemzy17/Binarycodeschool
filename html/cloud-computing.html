        <br />
        <p>
          From artificial intelligence to web applications, cloud computing is
          the foundation of many emerging technologies. Instead of businesses
          relying on physical computing infrastructures, cloud computing
          delivers technology services and resources, such as servers, storage,
          databases, and software, over the Internet on demand. Cloud computing
          is at the core of current and emerging technologies, transforming the
          way we live and work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cloud computing provides businesses with scalability, cost savings,
          and easy access to resources from anywhere with Internet access. As a
          result, cloud computing jobs like cloud administrator are in high
          demand. Train online in the Binary Code School Cloud Computing
          Bootcamp to learn the skills to qualify for this role and more.
