          Cybersecurity professionals work to prevent cyber attacks by
          safeguarding companies and individuals against online theft,
          disruption, misdirection, and unauthorized access to their electronic
          data and services.

          What is the application process for Binary Code School Cyber Bootcamp?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            Like our curriculum, our application process is streamlined—to get
            started, complete your application. From there, you’ll take a
            30-minute, open-book logic-based assessment (find tips here). Within
            a few business days, you’ll receive an admissions decision. Keep in
            mind that at any point in the process, you can schedule a time to
            speak with a Student Advisor (SA). SAs are dedicated to making sure
            you feel confident entering your cybersecurity training by answering
            any questions along the way.

          Do you get a certificate for completing the program?

          <p>

          Does the cybersecurity bootcamp prepare students for industry
          certification exams?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            Through bootcamp training and additional study, students will be
            prepared for several industry-recognized certifications and courses
            from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Computing Technology Industry
            Association (CompTIA). While these certifications are not a
            requirement of bootcamp, they are highly recommended for career
            success.

          What kinds of jobs do cybersecurity analytics bootcamp graduates find?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            Cybersecurity career paths vary depending on your skills and
            experience. During bootcamp, you’ll gain cybersecurity skills that
            will assist you throughout your career journey, from beginner and
            beyond. You’ll train for roles such as IT Help Desk Specialist,
            Information Technology Analyst, and Cybersecurity Analyst, and more.
            The Binary Code School Career Success Team is also available to
            assist you with your job search. Employers who have hired Binary Code School Cyber grads include the Center for Internet Security, the
            IRS, and Accenture.

          Can I keep working while studying in the program?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            Part-Time students often continue working full-time while completing
            the bootcamp. Keep in mind, however, that there are 9 hours in class
            with an additional 6-8 hours of homework each week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Full-Time students do not continue working due to the immersive
            nature of the Binary Code School Cyber Bootcamp. By focusing solely on their
            training, they’re set up to thrive in the expedited 12-week
            training. Full-time students can expect to spend an additional 8-10
            hours outside of the classroom on homework and assignments.

          How do Binary Code School's online cybersecurity classes work?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            We’ve received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our online
            Binary Code School Cyber Bootcamp students about their experience
            learning technical skills in an online format with Binary Code School. Our proven method features live instruction and a
            project-based curriculum which are both well-suited to remote
            learning.

          Do I need to have my own laptop/computer in order to do the program,
          and if so, what are the system requirements?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            You do need to provide your own computer for the bootcamp. It can be
            a laptop or desktop as long as it meets minimum tech specifications.
            We highly recommend Apple computers for our program, however, it is
            possible to use Windows with some modifications. You must have at
            least MacOS 10.15 or newer or Windows 10. Because the bootcamp is
            live-online, you are required to have a webcam and microphone in
            order to participate in class.
