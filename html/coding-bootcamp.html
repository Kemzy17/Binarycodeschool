            A word of advice to older prospective students like myself. You may
            be frustrated where you are right now but afraid to make the leap,
            to quit your job, to spend your savings on a bootcamp, to take three
            months to learn, to work 80 hours a week. I promise it’s worth it.

            Binary Code School is, by all measures, the best investment I have
            made to date, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody
            considering it, especially those with little to no prior programming
            knowledge. I will note, however, that hard, consistent, and
            dedicated individual work is a must if you want to make the most out
            of the Binary Code School investment.

            excited about. During my interviews, both companies were pleasantly
            surprised by how knowledgeable and capable a bootcamp grad could be.

          Why should I choose the Software Engineering Bootcamp at Binary Code School?

            No matter where you are in your coding journey, you can hone the
            skills, knowledge, and practical experience of a professional web
            developer with Binary Code School. As a trusted trailblazer in tech
            education, we’ve helped over 10,000+ students graduate job-ready
            with the skills, drive, and portfolio to build lasting, thriving
            careers in tech.

          Why does Binary Code School teach Full Stack JavaScript?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            The future of web development has moved toward sophisticated,
            responsive, and dynamic single-page applications running in the
            browser. Apps like Gmail, Asana, Trello, Facebook, and Google Maps
            have redefined what users expect from web applications and what
            developers need to deliver. After observing these trends, plus
            conducting lots of research and conversations with industry experts,
            we’ve come to the conclusion that full stack JavaScript is the
            future of web development. Consequently, it is what we primarily
            immerse our students in at Binary Code School. What about Ruby on
            Rails, Python, or other engineering languages? Why are other schools
            teaching these-or a combination of these- instead? Ruby on Rails has
            been instrumental in consolidating many best practices in back-end
            web development–making it easier for developers to build large sites
            in an organized way. Meanwhile, Python has completely revolutionized
            the way sites record and use data—and we do teach Python
            foundational skills in our Data Analytics bootcamps. Primarily,
            though, research and use cases show that today’s web runs on highly
            interactive and responsive experiences that don’t require a page
            refresh at every step. As a result, single-page applications (SPAs)
            written in JavaScript using frameworks like React or Vue.js make
            JavaScript one of the best programming languages to learn.
            JavaScript also offers professional advantages over other languages.
            Binary Code School graduates are well-rounded coders with both a
            thorough understanding of the full stack and programming concepts in
            general. We’ve learned through years of tech education that students
            may more easily understand and master other coding languages once
            they’ve learned full stack JavaScript. This gives our graduates a
            more in-demand skill set that separates them from the competition
            and widens the range of coding job types they’re qualified for.
